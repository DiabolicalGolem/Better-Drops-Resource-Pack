# ![pack.png](https://github.com/DiabolicalGolem/Better-Drops-Resource-Pack/blob/main/pack.png) Better Drops \(Resource Pack\)

*Adding drops to the dropless.*


## About

This is the resource pack that contains concept art for a potential "Better Drops" Mod. The author was tired of seeing so many mobs added that have no purpose to the overall game, so the aim is to simply add drops to the mobs that have no drops!

## Installing

Because this is just a resource pack, there is no way for it to interface with the game on its own. To properly experience the concept, you must also install a [datapack](https://github.com/DiabolicalGolem/Better-Drops-Datapack/tree/main) ([instructions here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Installing_a_data_pack)) that alters the loot tables of the mobs in question.
